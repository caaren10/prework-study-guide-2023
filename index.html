        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul> 
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which provide context and basic framework for the webpage</li>
          <li>There are different types of elements: text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. These contents are not visible when the user enters the webpage. Metadata helps the browser render the page correctly. This element is a container for metadata. This is content is used for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul> 
          <li>CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>CSS is used to define the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS</li>
          <li>inline CSS and internal CSS are both used when a developer styles an element directly in HTML, and it is specific to the HTML tag</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and Internal CSS are both useful for quick changes</li>
          <li>However, styling using inline or internal CSS is permanent and not flexible</li>
          <li>External CSS is the most common way to style a webpage</li>
          <li>External CSS allows most developers t keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</li>
          <li>VOCABULARY: separation of concerns - this refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet do not forget to add a link to the HTML in the head section in the metadata.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b [branch-name]: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch</li>
          <li>git commit -m "[description]": this code commits the file and adds a message with what the commit contains</li>
          <li>git pull: this command receives a branch's modifications in the local environment</li>
          <li>git push origin: this command pushes the changes made locally to the remote GitHub branch. the origin code indicates the sorice of the pull will be in the GitHub repo.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>you should become familiar with Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Third party APIs, and Third Party Frameworks abd libraries</li>
          <li> Become familiar with variables. Variables may hold different data types whether it is a string, number, boolean, array, or an opbject.</li>
          <li>become familiar with for loops, conditional statements, and functions.</li>
          <li> a for loop can iterate over the array and log each topic in the console with only a few lines of code, while a function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li> 
          <li>additionaly, unlike for loops and conditional statements, a function needs to be called in order to execute. it is not automatic.</li>
          <li> thus, there are two requirements for a JavaScript function: 1) define the function and 2) call the function</li>
          <li> we will learn more about the properties of the JavaScript built-in Math Object </li>
